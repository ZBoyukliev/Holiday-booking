# Holiday-booking
Create an Angular app that utilizes Bootstrap and SCSS for booking hotels. The application interfaces with the SoftUni practice server. To initiate the app, begin by navigating to the 'server-holiday' folder and executing the command 'node server.js'. This will start the server. Next, navigate to the 'holiday-booking' folder and run the command 'ng s' to launch the app.

Upon successful launch, the app presents a public section where all available hotels are listed; however, their complete details are not accessible at this point. To access full details, user registration is necessary. Once registered, users can explore comprehensive information about the hotels. Additionally, a 'Create Hotel' button is visible. Registered users have the capability to create their own hotels, and they can perform updates and deletions as well. These editing options are exclusive to the user who owns the respective hotel.
